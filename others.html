                Climate change is a big problem, and often it can feel as though there is nothing you can do to stop this problem. But this is simply wrong; there are plenty of things you can do.

            <h4>
                Petitions
            </h4>
            <p>
                Petitions are an easy and effective way to force the government to take action and make real climate progress. Many environmental petitions can be found on the House of Commons website, and can be signed extremely easily. One such petition, to end fossil fuel subsidies, is found at <a href="https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-4368">this link</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Reducing Electricity Consumption
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                This idea is said a lot, because it's true. Because our electricity still comes from dirty energy like coal, reducing the amount of coal you burn can by reducing the amount of energy you use can make a real effect.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Spreading the Word
            </h4>
            <p>
                Finally, you can spread news about climate change and how you are taking action, hopefully inspiring others to do the same. Sharing this website and the protest on social media will get more people involved and make the threat to Nova Scotia Power even bigger. The same is true for other actions; speaking out against leaders who ignore climate change, considering climate change when you shop or give money to banks, and even asking car companies for electric alternatives are all ways to spread the news that more people care about climate change.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hopefully, something on this website has inspired you to do something about climate change, and I deeply thank you for your support of this protest and everything that it stands for.
