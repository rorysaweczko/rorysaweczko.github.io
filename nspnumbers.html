                On their website, Nova Scotia Power shows pie charts showing how they will reach 80% renewable energy by 2030? But how exactly are they doing this?
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The bottom line is, they aren't. Nova Scotia Power has never released a plan stating how they expect to reach this target, when currently nearly 50% of their energy comes from burning coal. The only mention on how they intend to meet this target is when they reference buying electricity from Muskrat Falls in Labrador and from Hydro Quebec.

                In actual numbers, Nova Scotia Power has announced the creation of two new wind farms, with a total of 40 windmills between them and a generating capacity of 200 megawatts. This translates to only 6% of energy in Nova Scotia, and the project is not going to be completed until 2024. No other renewable energy plans have been announced, and it is clear that Nova Scotia Power lacks a plan.

                How will Nova Scotia Power manage to meet its climate goals? Through the purchase of electricity from Hydro Quebec and Labrador, but also through new improvements in Nova Scotia; mainly, the use of solar and wind power.

                Nova Scotia is home to an incredible amount of coast and ocean, making us the perfect place for an offshore wind farm. The massive windd turbines in these farms are capable of producing much more electricity than normal, and they do not take up space on land. In addition, the wind is more reliant on the ocean, meaning more power is generated. All in all, we have the potential to utilise our great offshore wind potential; thats why we are demanding that Nova Scotia Power start this process with the creation of a 900 megawatt offshore wind farm. In addition, supplying customers with solar panels will be able to increase our renewable percentage.
