            <h3>
                The Paris Agreement is likely one of the most quoted agreements in all climate change talks. But what is it really, and are Nova Scotia Power, and the province itself, living up to the agreement?
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h4>
                What is the Paris Agreement?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Paris Agreement is an agreement signed by 195 countries which aimes to limit climate change to no more than 1.5 degrees celcius above pre-industrial temperatures. This can be achieved by reducing our carbon emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and then by achieving net zero emissions soon after that. Our global temperatures are already close to breaching the Paris Agreement, so we have no time to waste.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Nova Scotia's Climate Goal
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                In Nova Scotia, the provincial government has comitted to reducing carbon emissions to 53% below 2005 levels by 2030, and then reaching net zero by 2050. This target is compatible with the terms of the Paris Agreement, which is great! However, the government actually needs to achieve this goal, and there is a suspicious lack of funding towards doing so. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Nova Scotia Power
            </h4>
            <p>
                As part of Nova Scotia's climate plan, the provincial government states that all coal plants must be closed by 2030, and that there must be a 90% reduction in emissions from electricity by that time. Nova Scotia Power, however, is not following this policy. While they state that all coal plants will be closed by 2030, they have only comitted to 80% renewable energy by 2030; short of what is required by the government, and the Paris Agreement. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While the government targets are appropriate, we must use caution to ensure that these targets are actually reached to uphold the Paris Agreement. In particular, Nova Scotia Power is not meeting its targets, nor does it have any plan to. This is a serious threat to our ability to tackle climate change, and we must deal with it now.
