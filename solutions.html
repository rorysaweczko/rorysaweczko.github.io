            <h3>
                Nova Scotia power has often said that they are not capable of reaching the target due to a lack of support from Muskrat Falls generating station. However, there is more to the story, and Nova Scotia can do more.

            <h4>
                Wind Energy
            </h4>
            <p>
                Nova Scotia is fortunate enough to be an extremely windy province, and Nova Scotia Power has used this by havaing the greatest percentage of wind energy in the country, according to their website. However, we have the potential to do so much more, particularly with the capacity for offshore wind farms. By setting up a massive offshore wind farm near Halifax, Nova Scotia Power could create 900 megawatts of power; nearly a third of the current grid. This energy will go a long way into helping meet our climate goals.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Solar Energy
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Solar energy is one of the cheapest forms of energy, and can easily be installed on the homes of customers to help reduce the need for fossil-fuel generated energy. Solar panels require little maintenance, are relatively easy to install, and have long lives. So much more can be done to utilise these resources. Nova Scotia Power should invest much more in solar power, perhaps by installing solar panels on the homes of consumers or creating solar gardens.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Buying Renewable Energy
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is an option that has frequently been explored by Nova Scotia Power to help meet the energy needs of the province. Hydro Quebec and energy from Muskrat Falls are frequently cited by many. While these will not solve the problem on their own, they are effective. By completing the Atlantic Loop project, we can get more clean energy from Quebec and help reach our climate goals. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All in all, Nova Scotia Power needs to do much more. More investment in wind farms is needed, as well as the distribution of solar panels and purchase of clean energy from other provinces. With a combination of all of these things, Nova Scotia Power can meet its climate goals.
